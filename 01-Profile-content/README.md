## Background & Objectives

A simple challenge to manipulate basic HTML tags and create a profile page with headers/texts/lists/images/tables.

Note: You can start a local webserver by typing the following command in your terminal (just make sure you are in the exercise's folder):

```bash
$ serve
```

(it has been defined in an [alias](https://github.com/lewagon/dotfiles/blob/f894306fd81502f1fe513dd253e3129f4b56874d/aliases#L7))

- You can now visit your files on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
- Sometimes, you may have to kill the server with **Ctrl + C** and start it again with `serve`.

## Specs

Build a simple HTML profile page with the following elements (use the right HTML tags):

- an image of yourself
- a header and sub-header with your name and position
- a description of yourself
- a list of your social links
- a table of your projects, favorite movies, programming languages, sport teams, recipes, etc... whatever you want.

A picture is worth a thousand words, [here is what you should build in this challenge](http://lewagon.github.io/html-css-challenges/01-profile-content/)

## Further suggestions & resources

- Prepare your image files (1 profile picture + 3 movie pictures) before starting to code. Ensure your **profile image is square** (you can crop it to make it square) and ensure **your movies pictures are all the same width**.
- Don't forget the basic skeleton tags `<html>`, `<body>`, `<head>`.
- Don't forget the page `<title>` in the `<head>` section, and other important metatags like `<meta charset="utf-8">`.
- You can use [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) to find nice icons (e.g. for social networks). It is a very convenient library since it is a **font** of icons (hence it will be very easy to resize these icons, change their color, and add animations on them!)
- You can use the `target="_blank"` attribute on your links to open them on new tabs once clicked.

## Indent or die

**Take your time to indent your HTML carefully**. HTML code has a lot of nestings, way more than ruby. If you don't indent, you are dead!

Which code do you understand best? This one:

```html
<ul>
    <li><a href="#">
        <i class="fa fa-facebook"></i> Facebook
  </a>
</li><li>
  <a href="#">
    <i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i> Linkedin
      </a></li>
<li>  <a href="#">
  <i class="fa fa-twitter"></i> Twitter
    </a>
  </li>
    </ul>
```

Or that one

```html
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="#">
      <i class="fa fa-facebook"></i> Facebook
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#">
      <i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i> Linkedin
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#">
      <i class="fa fa-twitter"></i> Twitter
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>
```
